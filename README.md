# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is designed to understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript in an easy to use webpage/application.

The soul reason for this study guide is to refer back to key points in the pre-work and edit new found skills to showcase in an already functioning webpage.

This will help eleviate confusion and having to flip between pages upon pages of notes on paper. The webpage will store everything I learn in an easy to navigate hub.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section of the study guide will showcase everything I have learned so far in the UO Coding Bootcamp.

I can navigate through HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript notes quickly and even access the DevTool console within Chrome.
